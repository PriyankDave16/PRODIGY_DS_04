# PRODIGY_DS_04
# Twitter Comments Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains my fourth task as a Data Science Intern at [Prodigy Infotech](https://www.prodigyinfotech.com/). This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on Twitter comments, involving crucial steps such as data cleaning, text preprocessing, and insightful visualization of sentiment trends.

## Project Overview

The objective of this task is to extract, process, and analyze sentiments from a collection of Twitter comments. This involves:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**: Importing the dataset containing Twitter comments and understanding its initial structure and content.
2.  **Text Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Applying various techniques to clean raw text data, such as removing irrelevant characters, stopwords, stemming/lemmatization (if applicable), and converting text to a suitable format for analysis.
3.  **Sentiment Analysis**: Utilizing libraries or methods to classify the sentiment of each tweet (e.g., positive, negative, neutral).
4.  **Data Visualization**: Creating visualizations to represent the distribution of sentiments, identify key trends, or show relationships between sentiment and other features.

## Files in this Repository

* `task04.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for data loading, text preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
* `twitter_comments.csv`: (Placeholder - please replace with the actual dataset name if different) The dataset containing Twitter comments.
    *(Please ensure this CSV file is present in the repository, or specify how to obtain it if it's from an external source.)*

## Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas**: For efficient data loading, manipulation, and cleaning.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**: For creating compelling data visualizations of sentiment distributions and trends.
* **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: For text preprocessing tasks (e.g., tokenization, stopwords removal, stemming/lemmatization).
* **TextBlob / VADER SentimentIntensityAnalyzer (or similar)**: For performing sentiment analysis.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project running on your local machine, please follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git](https://github.com/YourUsername/YourRepositoryName.git)
    cd YourRepositoryName
    ```
    (Remember to replace `YourUsername` and `YourRepositoryName` with your actual GitHub username and repository name.)

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn nltk textblob # Add other libraries as needed (e.g., vaderSentiment if using VADER)
    ```
    * **NLTK Data Download:** You might also need to download specific NLTK data packages. Open a Python interpreter or add the following to your notebook:
        ```python
        import trxtblob      
        ```

4.  **Obtain the dataset:**
    Ensure that the `twitter_comments.csv` file (or whatever dataset `task04.ipynb` relies on) is placed in the root directory of your cloned repository.

5.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook task04.ipynb
    ```
    This command will open the Jupyter Notebook in your web browser, where you can execute the cells to see the entire pipeline from data cleaning to sentiment visualization.

## Usage

Open the `task04.ipynb` notebook in your Jupyter environment. Run through the cells sequentially to observe:

* How raw Twitter comments are processed and cleaned.
* The application of sentiment analysis techniques.
* The visual representation of sentiment distribution across the comments.

You can modify the code to experiment with different text preprocessing steps, explore other sentiment analysis libraries, or analyze specific aspects of the Twitter data.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please consider:

* Implementing more advanced text preprocessing (e.g., handling emojis, slang).
* Comparing different sentiment analysis models.
* Integrating machine learning models for sentiment classification.
* Adding interactive visualizations.

Please fork the repository, create a new branch, and submit a pull request with your enhancements!
